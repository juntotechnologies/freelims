# Backup of Removed Scripts

This directory contains backups of scripts that were removed during consolidation of the FreeLIMS management system.

Date: Fri Feb 28 19:41:43 EST 2025

These scripts were consolidated into the new management system:
- `freelims.sh`: Main entry point for all FreeLIMS operations
- `scripts/system/manage.sh`: System operations (start, stop, restart)
- `scripts/user/manage.sh`: User management operations
- `scripts/db/manage.sh`: Database operations

If you need to restore any of these scripts, you can find them in this backup directory.
